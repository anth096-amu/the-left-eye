                <hr/>

                <h2>Extendable aerial combos</h2>
                <p>Bayonetta has dozens combos. The longer Bayonetta wants to continue her combo, the harder it is.</p>
                <p>She will take advantage on each of your single mistakes to drag you in her combo, dealing a lot of damage.</p>
                
                <h2>Excellent edge-guarding</h2>
                <p>The Umbra witch will take advantage of you being offstage whether by using the <em>Bullet Arts Extension</em>, by catching you with her strongest aerial (<em>Back Air</em>), or by spiking you with her fearsome <em>Heel Stomp</em>.</p>
            
                <h2>Special moves mechanics</h2>
                <p>Bayonetta can use her Side Bs and her Up Bs multiple times depending on the situation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From the ground, or after jumping from the ground, she has 1 Up B and 1 Side B left.</li>
                    <li>If she hits something with her <strong>first</strong> Side B, she still has 1 Side B left.</li>
                    <li>If she double jumps, she has 1 Up B left.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These rules allow the following schemes :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up B > Jump > Up B</li>
                    <li>Up B > Side B > Jump > Up B</li>
                    <li>Up B > Side B (hits) > Side B > Jump > Up B</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition of the precedent rules, it is possible to save a Jump by performing a <a href="./smash/technique.html">Jump Cancel</a>.</p>

                <h2>Learning curve</h2>
                <p>Bayonetta has quite the slow learning curve. If you want to be bayo people, you'll have to learn all of the <a href="smash/technique.html">character's mechanics</a>. </p>
                <p>For my personal experience, it took me about more than one month to get satisfying results with this character.</p>

                <h2>Tier</h2>
                <p>Bayonetta is often considered as a decent mid-tier character.</p>
                
                <h2>Should I pick Bayonetta as a main ?</h2>
                <p>If all you want is to have fun in SSBU, then yes, go for it. Bayonetta is one the most fun characters to play.</p>
                <p>However, Bayonetta lacks consistency. Some combos will work or won't work depending on <strong>SDI</strong> (smash directional influence).</p>
                <p>She also has a ton of landing lag, contrary to most of the cast, and that will be fustrating if you want to be TOP 1 (read more about landing lag in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KM7nYGL2NRmBSo7xwCMxmfLsKMnr8HP-ndUZiAkKS4A/edit#gid=1225612069" target="_blank">frame data</a>).</p>

                <h2>What is your experience with smash ?</h2>

                <h3>▸ Newbie</h3>
                <p>If this is your very first hours with the Super Smash Bros. Series, I highly discourage you to learn how to play Bayonetta.</p>
                <p>Characters like Mario and Lucina are more beginner-friendly.</p>

                <h3>▸ Intermediate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn her most basic <a href="./smash/combo-list">combos</a>.</li>
                    <li>Get acknowledge with her <a href="">frame data.</a></li>
                    <li>Be aware that Bayonetta gets more landing lag the more she uses her special moves.</li>
